4/8 solved in contest. +- 0 performance.
I had still 1.5h after solving the first for but i did not observe that f(t) <=1
is always possible in e. I think i would have managed then.
Maybe a wrong tactic but after some time i tried f which was much harder. I
felt like it was easier for me because i have a strong math background but
i could quite solve it.

solved e after reading the tutorial. Hopefully look at f soon.
