I am actually already above 1600 so 
div3 would have been unrated for me anyway.

Still doing a virtual participation because
i like the easier tasks for building confidence
and i am not supre fit today so im not trying 
super hard ones.

after virtual contest:
i was 10min to slow for f, maybe i would
have been a little faster in contest.
g still memory overflowing. Need to check
how to implement dfs efficiently.
